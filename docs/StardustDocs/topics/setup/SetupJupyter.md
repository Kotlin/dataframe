[Kotlin Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-jupyter) allows you to run Kotlin code 
in interactive [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org). 
Kotlin DataFrame is fully integrated and works seamlessly within these environments.

To use Kotlin DataFrame in a Jupyter notebook with the Kotlin Jupyter Kernel, 
follow the same steps as described in the [Setup in Kotlin Notebook](SetupKotlinNotebook.md).
